## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mr_speedy_ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mr_speedy_ruby

## Usage
This gem will provide service for integrating mr.speedy in your ruby app with
ease.

### Initialize Client
We can initialize mr.speedy api client by providing authentication token
located in our mr.speedy account setting.

```ruby
MrSpeedyRuby::Client.new(token: "mr-speedy-token")
```

### Calculate Delivey Fee
Send request to mr.speedy api for delivery fee calculation by providing delivery
and pickup details

```ruby
client = MrSpeedyRuby::Client.new(token: "mr-speedy-token")

# Pickup Location Details Including Contact Person and Package
pickup = {
  address: "Capitol Park Homes, 71 Berlin Avenue, Matandang Balara, Quezon City, Metro Manila",
  contact_person: { name: "Admin One", phone: "639123456789" },
  packages: []
}

# Delivery Location Details Including Contact Person and Package
delivery = {
  address: "Unit 802, EcoTower, 32nd Street corner 9th Avenue, BGC, Taguig, 1634 Metro Manila",
  contact_person: { name: "Admin One", phone: "639123456789" },
  packages: []
}

# Additional Parameters
options = { matter: "Food" }

client.calculate_fees(delivery: delivery, pickup: pickup, opts: options, sandbox: true)
```

Theres so many things happening here first we initialize our client by providing
token , then we pass delivery details as separate entity from options so we can
easily validate required delivery details parameter. We also pass additional
required parameter `matter` which indicates parcel type and lastly we call
`MrSpeedyRuby::Client#calculate_fees` to send request for delivery fee
calculation to mr.speedy api.

Also note we pass `sandbox` parameter with true value to indicate that we want
to make a request on mr.speedy sandbox server.

##### Note:

[Order Price Calculation](https://apitest.mrspeedy.ph/business-api/doc#calculate-order) parameters can also be passed as options.

[Delivery Details](https://apitest.mrspeedy.ph/business-api/doc#calculate-order) can also be passed along pickup/delivery params.

By default we set `MOTORBIKE` as default vehicle unless you pass `vehicle_type_id` as option for `opts`.

### Placing an Order
Send request to mr.speedy api to create order.

```ruby
client = MrSpeedyRuby::Client.new(token: "mr-speedy-token")

# Pickup Location Details Including Contact Person and Package
pickup = {
  address: "Capitol Park Homes, 71 Berlin Avenue, Matandang Balara, Quezon City, Metro Manila",
  contact_person: { name: "Admin One", phone: "639277876287" },
  packages: []
}

# Delivery Location Details Including Contact Person and Package
delivery = {
  address: "Unit 802, EcoTower, 32nd Street corner 9th Avenue, BGC, Taguig, 1634 Metro Manila",
  contact_person: { name: "Admin One", phone: "639277876287" },
  packages: []
}

# Additional Parameters
options = { matter: "Food" }

client.place_order(delivery: delivery, pickup: pickup, opts: options, sandbox: true)
```
Like `delivery fee calculation` we also do the same steps and pass the exact
parameter to ensure that we have the same `delivery fee`, We also set `sandbox`
parameter to true to test our implementation against sandbox server.

##### Note:

[Order Creation](https://apitest.mrspeedy.ph/business-api/doc#create-order) parameters can also be passed as options.

[Delivery Details](https://apitest.mrspeedy.ph/business-api/doc#create-order) can also be passed along pickup/delivery params.

By default we set `MOTORBIKE` as default vehicle unless you pass `vehicle_type_id` as option for `opts`.
